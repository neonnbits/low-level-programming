#### Electric Current
Electric current is the total charge that passes through some cross-sectional area A per
unit time.![[Pasted image 20241108182055.png]]
If ∆Q is the amount of charge passing through an area in a time interval ∆t, then
the average current $I_{\text{ave}}$ is defined as:
$$I_{\text{ave}} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$
Instantaneous current I is given by
$$I = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$
Instantaneous current means the current at a particular instant in time rather than taking average of current over a given time period. You can ask Claude to better understand this as it includes limits from mathematics.
- milliamps ($1mA = 1 \times 10^{\text{-3}} A$)
- microamps ($1\mu A = 1 \times 10^{\text{-6}}A$)
- nanoamps ($1nA = 1 \times 10^{\text{-9}}A$)

Charge on a single electron is given by
$$
Q_{electron} = -e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{C} \tag{2.2.a}
$$

Charge of a proton is:
$$
Q_{electron} = +e = +1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{C} \tag{2.2.b}
$$

if a current of 1 A flows through the copper wire, the number of electrons flowing by a cross section of the wire in 1 s is equal to:
$$1 \ \text{A} = \left( \frac{1 \ \text{C}}{1 \ \text{s}} \right) \left( \frac{\text{electron}}{-1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{C}} \right) = -6.24 \times 10^{18} \ \text{electrons/s}
$$

Current Perspective
- Laptop Computer - 2 A - 3 A
- TV - 1 A - 3 A
- Typical LED - 20 mA

#### 2.3 Voltage
We need voltage(potential-difference) to get electric current flow from one point to another. The voltage placed across the conductor gives rise to electro-motive force(EMF) that is responsible for giving all free electrons a push.

The electrons flow is from the negative terminal to the positive terminal and by convention we assume the current flow is in the opposite direction.
